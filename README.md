# astro-project-template
An Astro project, configured the way I usually start projects. Will update as and when I realise something should be set up differently!

## Includes:
- Sass setup with abstracts and base folders imported into global.scss
- Astro integrations built in (imagetools, SEO, prefetch, robots.txt and sitemap)
- Some basic starter CSS styling and dynamic rem sizing with media queries
- Autoprefixer installed and initialised
- `Layout.astro` containing the relevant integrations and styling as well as `Nav.astro` and `Footer.astro` imports (which are just filler components)
- `.vscode` directory configured with preffered settings which requires [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)
